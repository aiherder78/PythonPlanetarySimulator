The only python module you might need to install is pygame:

Use command "pip install pygame" first and you're good to go.

Enter command "python sim.py" to run the simulation.

Note:  You may have to modify the WIDTH and HEIGHT variables at the top of the program to match your screen resolution.

You should see a pygame window pop up with the planets moving in their orbits (Mercury through Neptune).
You can press + and - (not the ones on the keypad) to zoom in and out.  One keypress per zoom level change.
Click the X in the upper right hand corner of the window to exit the program.
